# DNS Setup Required for YouMeYou Platform SSL

## 🎯 Current Issue

From the screenshots, we can see:
- ❌ `https://youmeyou.ai/login` returns "404 page not found" 
- ⚠️ `staging.youmeyou.ai/login` loads but has CORS errors
- ✅ `portainer-staging.youmeyou.ai` is working (seen in nginx logs)

## 📋 Required DNS A Records

**Add these A records in your DNS provider (Hostinger/Cloudflare):**

```
Type: A
Name: youmeyou.ai (or @)
Value: 34.93.209.77
TTL: 300

Type: A  
Name: staging
Value: 34.93.209.77
TTL: 300

Type: A
Name: portainer-staging
Value: 34.93.209.77
TTL: 300

Type: A
Name: registry-staging
Value: 34.93.209.77
TTL: 300

Type: A
Name: registry-ui-staging
Value: 34.93.209.77
TTL: 300
```

## 🔍 DNS Verification Commands

After adding DNS records, verify they resolve correctly:

```bash
# Check main domain
nslookup youmeyou.ai
dig youmeyou.ai A

# Check staging domain  
nslookup staging.youmeyou.ai
dig staging.youmeyou.ai A

# Check management domains
nslookup portainer-staging.youmeyou.ai
nslookup registry-staging.youmeyou.ai
nslookup registry-ui-staging.youmeyou.ai
```

**Expected result:** All should return `34.93.209.77`

## 🚀 SSL Setup Process

Once DNS records are properly configured:

1. **Run the SSL setup script:**
   ```bash
   scp portainer-stacks/setup-dns-ssl-step-by-step.sh ubuntu@34.93.209.77:/home/ubuntu/
   ssh ubuntu@34.93.209.77
   chmod +x setup-dns-ssl-step-by-step.sh
   ./setup-dns-ssl-step-by-step.sh
   ```

2. **The script will:**
   - ✅ Check DNS resolution for all domains
   - 🔒 Generate SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt
   - 🔧 Configure nginx with SSL
   - 🚀 Deploy SSL-enabled gateway
   - 🧪 Test all HTTPS endpoints

## 🌐 Expected Final URLs

After successful setup:

- **Main App:** `https://youmeyou.ai` → Codaloo Web Application
- **Staging:** `https://staging.youmeyou.ai` → Staging Environment  
- **Management:** `https://portainer-staging.youmeyou.ai` → Portainer (IP restricted)
- **Registry:** `https://registry-staging.youmeyou.ai` → Docker Registry (IP restricted)
- **Registry UI:** `https://registry-ui-staging.youmeyou.ai` → Registry UI (IP restricted)

## 🔧 Current Web App Issue

The main issue is that `youmeyou.ai` returns 404 because:

1. **DNS may not be pointing to the VM** (needs verification)
2. **Web application stack may not be deployed** 
3. **Nginx routing may be incorrect**

## 📝 Action Items

1. **First:** Add all DNS A records listed above
2. **Wait:** 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation
3. **Verify:** DNS resolution using the commands above
4. **Run:** The SSL setup script
5. **Deploy:** Codaloo web application stack if not already deployed
6. **Test:** All HTTPS endpoints

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **IP Restriction:** Portainer and registry services are restricted to your IP only
- **CORS Updates:** After SSL setup, update microservice CORS origins to use HTTPS URLs
- **Certificate Renewal:** SSL certificates will auto-renew (90-day validity)
- **Firewall:** Ports 80 and 443 must be open for SSL verification and HTTPS traffic
