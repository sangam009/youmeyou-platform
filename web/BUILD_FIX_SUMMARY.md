# Build Fix Summary

## Issue
The Next.js build was failing with errors related to server-side Node.js modules (fs, net, etc.) being imported in client-side code. This was caused by the `@a2a-js/sdk` package trying to import Express server components in the browser bundle.

## Error Details
```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'fs'
Module not found: Can't resolve 'net'
```

The error trace showed:
```
./node_modules/express/lib/request.js
./node_modules/@a2a-js/sdk/build/src/server/a2a_express_app.js
./src/lib/a2aStreaming.ts
./src/lib/canvasApi.ts
./src/app/dashboard/design/page.tsx
```

## Solution
1. **Removed A2A SDK Dependency**: Removed `@a2a-js/sdk` from `package.json` as it was causing server-side imports in client code.

2. **Replaced with HTTP-based Implementation**: Updated `src/lib/a2aStreaming.ts` to use simple HTTP fetch requests instead of the A2A SDK.

3. **Cleaned Dependencies**: Removed node_modules and reinstalled to ensure clean state.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `package.json`
```diff
"dependencies": {
- "@a2a-js/sdk": "^0.2.1",
  "@google/generative-ai": "^0.24.1",
```

### 2. Updated `src/lib/a2aStreaming.ts`
- Removed A2A SDK imports
- Replaced with fetch-based HTTP requests
- Maintained the same interface for compatibility

### 3. Fixed Agent Function Calls
- Added missing `type` parameter to all `askAgent` calls
- Updated TypeScript interfaces to include the `type` field
- Added proper error handling and validation

## Build Status
✅ **Build now successful**
- Next.js build completes without errors
- All dependencies resolved correctly
- Application starts and responds correctly

## Testing
- ✅ `npm run build` - Success
- ✅ `npm run dev` - Server starts on port 3000
- ✅ HTTP 200 response from localhost:3000

## Future Considerations
- The current implementation uses simple HTTP requests instead of streaming
- For true streaming functionality, consider implementing Server-Sent Events (SSE) or WebSocket connections
- The A2A SDK can be used on the server-side (design-microservice) without affecting the client build
